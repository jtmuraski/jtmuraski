### About Me

Hello there!

I am a Software Engineer based out of the Twin Cities area of Minnesota, and I make it my business to solve problems. I started my programming journey in 2004=2005 during my senior year of High School when I took my firts programming
class and learned my first programming language: C++! That's right, I didn't start with Javascript or Python, I learned to code the hard way with C++ and I am all the more grateful for it!
I specialize in C#/.NET, Java and Amazone Web Services.

Even though I started programming in 2004-2005, I didn't start working in tech until 2020. After college, I spent several years in the US Army and working in Manufacturing. In total
I spent 9 years in the Army National Guard, and 8 years in Manufacutring, in the following positions:
  - 3 years as a Production Supervisor in heavy industrial manufacturing
  - 3 years as a Manufacturing Lead in Medical Device Manufacturing
  - 2 years as a Manufacturing Engineer

Why bring that up? Because those experiences I found have given me a very unique perspective and skillset that sets me apart from other engineers - I bring a jeans and boots work attitude
to my programming and I can speak the language and understand what it is my clients need to do their jobs. Because its what I needed to do mine!

### Engineering Philosophy

I have a couple of core philosophies that I do my best to stick with when desiging and building software solutions to solve problems:
1) Business should not have to change and conform their practices, culture and processes to software, every business deserves software that reflects who they are as a business. This means
   I strive to make products for my clients that will fit in with their processes and to do it a manner that they want.
2) Build simple, effective solutions. Complicated UI's and endless amounts of data entry turns off users. I design my systems to be as automatic as possible and to use as 
   little user input as is necessary to do that job.
3) BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front). I don't string my clients or coworkers around when it comes to tasks and updates. If it doesn't work say why, if the requirements don't make sense, say something!
4) Working within Regulated Industry. I spent 5 years working in Medical Device Manufacturing, and as such became intimiatly familiar with regulations such as FDA CFR 21 and ISO 13485 and how to work 
   with those regulations. This also means I know how to perform under government audits.

### Current Work

Since 2020, I have been working on data and process automation for different factories. What this means is that I automate as much data flow as possible including getting data from machines
and updating databases with them, and building web apps for Operators to interact with their data, orders and products. I use C#/.NET to build these applications as well as a suite of tools
provided by Symphony AI.

### My Personal Projects

Since I've been busy with work and raising 3 kids, I haven't had much time for personal projects lately, but I always have 1 or 2 ongoing! Check out my pinned projects for more info.
